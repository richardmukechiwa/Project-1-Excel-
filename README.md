### Analyzing the market trends and impact of Netflix from 2008 - 2021

## Executive Summary

An analysis of Netflix market trends, production levels, popularity, and global coverage as affected by different factors.  The recommendations are meant to guide on what should be done to cover the low production periods, where to increase supply, and new markets to penetrate.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Netflix data ranging from 2008 to 2021 to observe the distribution, trends, content preference by country, and the most favored genres.

## Data Source

The Netflix dataset was extracted from Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

I loaded the CSV dataset into Power Query for cleaning and transformation. Most of the columns were cleaned except the date-added column, which had mixed date formats. I split the date and used the year only for my analysis since it was not affected by the changes.

## Data Analysis

### 1. What is the distribution of content types (movies vs. TV shows) in the dataset?

There are more movies than TV shows, which shows that TV shows are less preferred to movies.

### 2. Which directors have the highest number of titles in the dataset?

There are several directors with the highest count of titles, including Rajiv Chilaka, who has 20 titles, followed by Alistair Fothergill, Raul Campos, and Jan Suter.

### 3. What are the top countries with the most content available on Netflix?

United States of America has the most content on Netflix, of about 3239 titles, This can be due to factors like the ratio of resources available to the population, like electricity power supply distribution and Wi-Fi coverage Also, the United States has been a good market for a long time.  India is second, with titles of around 1057. This can be due to the size of the population and the resources available; the number of people who have access to Wi-Fi is low as compared to the USA.  The Indian film industry is still growing, and culture can also play a big role. Some content may be regarded as not appropriate. The third-placed country is the United Kingdom, which has 638 titles on Netflix. This can be caused by competition with other players who have dominated the UK market and have been accepted by the people.   I have also found out that African nations are not included in the top list. This is caused by poor network connectivity, wi-fi accessibility,  and knowledge gaps 

### 4. How has the number of titles added to Netflix changed over time?

The graph shows that from 2008 to 2014, the number of titles added to the Netflix platform was at its lowest. After the year 2014, the titles started to increase. This can be due to the increase in video production and distribution technologies. In 2019, Netflix had 2016 titles added, which was the highest number.  From there, the title numbers began to drop. This is the time when lockdown was imposed to try and control the spread of COVID-19; therefore, no new movie productions were worked on during that period.

### 5. What are the most common genres in the dataset, and how do they vary across different countries?

The most common genres in their order are documentaries, stand-up comedy, international movies, kids TV and dramas, and independent movies. The United States of America has the largest presentation, dominating documentaries, stand-up comedy, and kids TV. India dominates international movies, independent movies, and dramas. The United Kingdom has the highest number of viewers for documentaries.

###  Recommendations 

-  The United States proves to be a good market for documentaries and stand-up comedy, we have to increase the accessibility of such genres to the US market.
-  The Indian market must be provided with more international movies and independent movies.
-  There is a need for post-COVID-19 analyses of the performance of Netflix content to have a better understanding of how the market 
is responding.
-  Data collection must be thoroughly done and checked to avoid missing important data that can impact our results and data-driven decisions.
- The African market needs to be researched to find out what best suits them and how best to penetrate.
